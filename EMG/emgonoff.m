function onoff = emgonoff(rawemg, fs, ws, sd)
    % EMGONOFF - Find on/off times and indicies of raw EMG data.
    % Calculate average(mean) value of resting EMG
    % Define "on" EMG as the sample where average value of EMG in a given window
    % range around the sample is a given # of std. dev. above avg. resting EMG.

    % Use the mouse to select two ranges of "resting" EMG from a graph of the
    % full-wave rectified EMG data.  Click four times: start and end of 1st
    % resting range, and start and end of 2nd resting range.  Mouse clicks need
    % to be consecutive and in order of increasing time (i.e. left-to-right on
    % the graph).  The first range should precede the EMG burst associated with
    % the muscle contraction under consideration.  The sedond range should be 
    % the resting EMG data immediately following the EMG burst.
    %
    % rawemg = input file raw emg data (1-column vector)
    % fs = sampling rate of raw EMG data in Hz
    % ws = window size in milliseconds (50ms @ 2400Hz = 120 samples)
    % sd = number of std. deviations above resting rms emg to trigger an "ON"
    % Default values: 
    %   ws = 50ms
    %   sd = 1
    % Algorythm for EMG onset & offset taken from

    % the determination of onset of muscle contraction using electromyography._
